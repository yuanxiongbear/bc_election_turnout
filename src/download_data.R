"This script downloads data from one or more url links and saves it to a given
file path. The file path can be an absolute path or a relative path, but it
should not include the ending file name. The file name will come from the base
name of the url link itself.

Usage: src/download_data.R <url_list>... --path=<path>

Options:
<url_list>...         Takes one or more space separated urls to a downloadable
                      csv file. At least one url is required.

--path=<path>         Takes a path to where the data should be saved.
                      This can be a relative or an absolute path, but it should
                      not include the file name. The downloaded files will be
                      named according to the basename of the url. If the path
                      does not exist, it will be automatically created.
                      This is a required argument.
